## 📖 Project Description

This project is a modern, responsive **landing page** designed for a fictional startup or digital service. The goal was to simulate a real-world front-end client project by crafting an engaging and fully responsive interface to improve customer retention and conversions.

Landing pages are essential tools for startups to create strong first impressions, communicate their value, and drive user actions. This project helps address that need through clean UI, responsive layout, and strategic call-to-actions (CTAs).
